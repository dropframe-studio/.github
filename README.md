# Dropframe Studio

**A lean studio that turns ideas into deployable assets.**

## What We Build

Dropframe is the packaging and delivery layer of the VSM Program ecosystem. We turn creative process artifacts into production-ready assets through:

- **Style-System** — Token-first design DNA
- **Content Factor** — Artifact capture and repurposing
- **Radiant Seven** — Mythic narrative and visual identity
- **VSM School** — Systems thinking curriculum and tools

## Core Projects

- **[style-system](link)** — Design tokens and brand templates
- **[content-factor](link)** — Process-to-content pipeline
- **[radiant-seven](link)** — Narrative framework and asset vault
- **[vsm-school](link)** — One-screen systems and learning tools

## How We Work

Weekly sprints. 1-2 concrete deliverables. Systems thinking as a lens. Everything documented as we build.

## Current Phase

First 90 days. One developer, eight AI collaborators, lots of momentum.
